# Template Tags

Dynamic content can be placed in the _template_ (but not _pages_). Example template tags include:

* `{{BUILD_UTC_DATE}}` - day the page was _built_ (UTC time)
* `{{BUILD_UTC_TIME}}` - time the page was _built_ (UTC time)
* `{{BUILD_TIME_MS}}` - how long the page took to build (milliseconds)
